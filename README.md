# Graph_Upward_Drawing

Graph_Upward_Drawing is a Computer Science project I have made with Farouk Khlifi. This project was proposed in professor Benjamin Doerr's class and was created by Luca Castelli Aleardi.

You can find a very precise description of the tasks as well as the algorithms we created in the written report.

The main goal was to create algorithms to minimize the number of edge crossings among all the valid representations of a given oriented a-cyclic graph. A valid representation is a straight-line drawing of the graph on a 2-dimensional integer grid where all the edges "go strictly upward".

All the code is available in this repository.
